### 👋 Hi there, I'm Ashwin

I am a **Machine Learning Engineer at Bloomberg**, where I build high-performance systems to bridge the gap between complex data and actionable intelligence. My technical focus lies at the intersection of **NLP** and **large-scale ML infrastructure**.

### 🧠 Beyond the Code

When I’m not optimizing models or scaling systems, I trade production environments for the study of **Psychology and Philosophy**. I am deeply fascinated by the "human algorithm", exploring how we think, why we act, and the ethical frameworks that guide our evolution.

I document these reflections and existential deep-dives over at [ashwinbhola.github.io](https://ashwinbhola.github.io/).
